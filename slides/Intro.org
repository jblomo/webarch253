* Web Architecture 253 :slide:
  + Jim Blomo & Molly Robison

* Course Goals :slide:
  + Address Bar -> Web Page
  + Challenges building Web Apps
  + Leverage existing technology

* We'll Do Stuff :slide:
  + 11 Homework Assignments
  + 1 Projects: Building a simple web app
  + lecture, break, lecture, break, lab -> homework
  + Python
** Homework Details :notes:
  + HW and projects due at midnight Thursday before class
  + Each 24 hours late == 10% off
  + HW & Projects most often turned in by GitHub

* But Don't Worry :slide:
  + This isn't a programming class
  + Grades are based on understanding of the concepts, not the craziest app
  + Molly & I are here to help

* This is a Graduate class :slide:
  + Perform well without supervision
  + Readings will mostly come from documentation and online guides
  + TMTOWTDI
  + Getting frameworks working on your computer
** Style :notes:
   + More firehouse than spoon feed, you'll need to follow up for 
     understanding
   + In exchange, grading will be relaxed and check for understanding
   + Honor system: No copying code or answers. Helping each other with 
     concepts is encouraged, but document it.

* Lectures & Labs :slide:
  + Start with Q&A for at least 10 minutes
  + Expect to be asked a question
  + Breaks
  + Stick around and get the first question of HW done
  + Slides on http://jblomo.github.io/webarch253/
** Helpful tips :notes:
   + Helpful to me if you say your name
   + Sorry, I tend to forget names
   + If I am not calling on you, check to make sure you are on the class list!
   + I'm not taking attendance, but let me know if you can't make it so I 
     won't call on you, Bueller Bueller Bueller

* Office Hours :slide:
  + We'll stay after class
  + or schedule a Hangout call
  + [[http://piazza.com][Piazza]]
  + Wait list will be processed normally until 3rd week... then I'll accept 
    everyone who's asked or answered a question

* Grades :slide:
  + 30% Homework
  + 30% Midterm
  + 40% Project

** Grading :notes:
   + In the past, I've used straight grading (90 A- 92.5 A 97.5 A+)

* The Web is Important :slide:
  + Democratizes Information
  + Decentralized
  + Low Barrier to Entry
** World Wide!  :notes:
   + People are now getting educated by Berkeley professors that have never 
     left their home village
   + I am personally upset when people are denied opportunity, the web is 
     changing that
   + Diabetes diagnosis

* The Web is Important :slide:center:

* Why are *YOU* in this class? :slide:

* The Web is built on composable parts :slide:
  + Network Stack
  + Internet
  + HTTP
  + HTML & CSS
  + Scripting (eg. Javascript)
  + Browsers & Devices
** Why is composability important? :notes:
   + Always dip down to lower levels for more control
   + Ability to swap out components
   + Gradual upgrades
   + Can read HTML off a hard drive, or deliver by HTTP
   + SSL can encrypt any type of traffic (HTTPS most common)

** Highway vs. Railway :slide:
   [[file:img/Los-Angeles-Highway-USA.jpeg]]

   vs

   [[file:img/Amberley_narrow_gauge_track.jpg]]

   [[file:img/track-gauge.png]]
** Trade-offs :notes:
   + You will hear a lot about trade-offs this semester
   + There is no "best" technical solution for every circumstance, engineering
     is fundamentally about trade-offs in the current situation
   + Here's an example trade-off: railway vs roads

** Highway: simple, composable :slide:
   + Just need something with wheels to use it effectively
   + Cars can drive on any highway, but also off-road
   + Bikes can use roads, too
   + Uncoordinated

** Railway: complected :slide:
   + Must have right width gauge
   + Must coordinate with other traffic
   + If you upgrade one part of the system, everything else must be upgraded
   + Efficient
   [[file:img/track-gauge.png]]

*** Complected: to braid together :notes:
    + Highways relatively inefficient: all cars need to power themselves 
      individually
    + traffic jams result from uncoordinated behavior
    + ~10x fuel efficiency in commuter trains
    + Tradeoff: flexibility for ease

* Network Stack :slide:
[[file:img/Osi-model.png]]
** Mostly used as conceptual reference
   + TCP/IP actually contains a section "Layering considered harmful"
   + TCP/IP
   + http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Osi-model.png

* :slide:
  [[file:img/the-internet-a-series-of-tubes.jpg]]
** Internet: A series of tubes :slide:
   + Longest running computer system in the world
   + Protocols are agnostic to their content
   + Pieces can be upgraded incrementally
   + Built on top of TCP/IP
*** Bits :notes:
    + How many computer system do you know that have never gone completely 
      down, or needed to be upgraded?
    + Ultimately the Internet is about moving bits around.
    + With that ability you can build what you want on top
    + From early email to streaming movies on your phone
      
* Protocols: Do you speak it? :slide:
  [[file:img/understand.jpeg]]
  + Protocols convey *data*
  + Data can be interpreted as *information*
** Metaphor :notes:
   + Speech is a protocol: sending data via sound
   + Understanding the words and their meaning in context is information

* HyperText Markup Language :slide:
  [[file:img/html-editing.jpg]]
  + HyperText: Text with links
  + HTML is the dominant, but not only, way to link text
  + HTML consists of elements, like a link or block of text
  + Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to modify the look of HTML
** Hypertext Editing System :notes:
   + Image shows another way to edit text
   + And you thought editing with a touch interface was new

* Javascript :slide:
  + General programming language, but designed with HTML in mind
  + Can "edit" HTML live on the page
  + Or "draw" on a canvas

#+END_HTML
** How it works :notes:
   + Elements represent different areas
   + Element attributes are manipulated

* Browsers show you HTML :slide:
  + because who wants to look at
#+begin_src html
    <div class="topsearch ">
        <form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/search"
        id="top_search_form" method="get">
  <a href="/search" class="advanced-search tooltipped downwards"
  title="Advanced Search">
  <span class="mini-icon mini-icon-advanced-search"></span></a>
  <div class="search placeholder-field js-placeholder-field">
#+end_src
** Lots of things are "browsers" :notes:
   + Many application actually embed a browser in the program and are 
     rendering HTML
   + Again: because the ideas around the Web are composable, it has spread to 
     many areas

* Questions :slide:
  + What is a type of HypterText?
  + What is a Protocol?
  + What are the advantages to composability?
