** Review :notes:
   + What is State?
   + Does a light switch have state?
   + Does a dice roll have state?
   + Do "commands"/turns within a phone conversation have state?
   + If a page is generated with a template, is it considered dynamic or
     static?
   + Are CSS and JS typically static or dynamic?
   + Webservers map URLs to what?
   + What is the server part of the url http://ischool.berkeley.edu/index.php?
   + What are the advantages of separating semantics from presentation?
   + Who controls HTML and HTTP specifications?

* HTTP is Stateless :slide:two_col:
  + *Pros*
  + Simple protocol
  + Easily distributable
  + No space requirements on server
   

  - *Cons*
  - Can't use relative paths
  - Must resend information (eg. Host)
  - Client must track state

* When is State Useful? :slide:animate:
   + Knowing which user
   + Logged In / Logged Out
   + Shopping Cart
** Think :notes:
   + Examples from class?

** Identification :slide:
   + Using HTTP commands, can we tell if we've seen this client before?

** No! :notes:
   + There's nothing in here that indicates an identity
   + Even if this user previously used a form to login
   + IP doesn't help: offices all use the same IP
   + So how do we tell one user from another?
   + ie, how can we provide information about the request?

* HTTP Headers are Meta-information :slide:
  + =Host= :: The host we're trying to contact
  + =Content-Type= :: The type and format of data in the response or request
  + =Cookie= :: Information about client, set by server

* Cookies :slide:

** Breakdown :notes:
   + Send a request (no cookies)
   + Server response normally, PLUS we get a cookie
   + Subsequent requests include the cookie

** Cookie's Life  :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/cookie_desktop.jpg]]
   + Initial request to server
   + Server response with =Set-Cookie= headers
     + Key-Value pairs, one per header
   + Client saves cookie values
   + Subsequent requests, client sends cookie values
     + Key-Value pairs, many per header

* Cookie Attributes :slide:
  + Specified after key-value in =Set-Cookie=


  + Domain and Path :: Scope of a cookie - when is it active?
  + Expires and Max-Age :: When should the browser delete the cookie?
  + Secure and HttpOnly :: Further limits scope to a protocol
** Security note :notes:
   + HTTP requests are in plain text, you can see an copy other cookies
   + So private cookies are only sent with HTTPS
   + Further reading in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Cookie_attributes][Cookie attributes]]

* 2033? :slide:two_col:
  + Maximum amount of time one can set
  + ~20 years (can depend on browser)
  + Year 2033

** Demo :notes:
   + Open Chrome to check cookies

* Authentication :slide:
#+begin_src http

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=jim&password=XXXX
#+end_src

#+begin_src http
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 231

Set-Cookie: logged-in=true

#+end_src

#+begin_src http
GET /homepage
Host: localhost
Cookie: user-id=5678; logged-in=true
#+end_src
*Warning*: There is something wrong with this example
** Security :notes:
   + Is there anything limiting you from connecting with Telnet and sending an
     arbitrary user-id?  Or setting logged-in?
   + So what do we send back instead?

** Secure Authentication :slide:
#+begin_src http
PUT /login HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 26

#+end_src

#+begin_src http

*** What is a visitor-id? :notes:
    + Nearly impossible to guess ID
    + ID is stored in a database, associated with status:
      + logged in
      + name
      + email
    + Server creates the ID
    + It is opaque to client, it just sends it back

* Types of Cookies :slide:
  + Session :: Exists until browser is closed
  + Persistent :: Exists for a specified time
  + Secure :: Only sent over secure connections (HTTPS)
  + Third-party :: Set for another domain, eg. advertiser
  + Ever / Zombie :: Tricks to avoid clearing cookies
** Secure :notes:
   + HTTP is plain text, so if someone can see your requests, they can see your
     cookie
   + How would they use your cookie?

* Cookie Review :slide:
  + Are cookies stored on the client or server?
  + Are cookies generated on the client or server?
  + Can a server trust the cookies being sent?
  + Can the browser decide which cookies to send?
  + What happens if we clear the =visitor-id= cookie from the example?

* The Auths :slide:
  + Authentication :: Who are you?
  + Authorization :: What are you allowed to do?
  + Access Controls :: What can you do to which resources?
** Real World :notes:
   + ID is proven by sending username and password via a form
   + Subsequently, ID is proven by providing token via a cookie
   + The *server* handles authorization since we cannot trust the cookie
     contents
   + Variety of ACL schemes that allow you to give RWX privileges for
     different resources

* Multi-step Wizards :slide:
  + Process that takes input from multiple pages
  + Doesn't do anything until final page is complete
  + How is the handled by HTTP?

** Example :slide:
[[file:img/WordPress-Easy-Install-1.jpg]]

** Example :slide:
[[file:img/WordPress-Easy-Install-2.jpg]]
*** Where are the choices? :notes:
    + Where are the options we selected in step 1?
    + We don't have any account yet, so usually can't store them in DB
    + Often they are in =hidden= input types in the form
    + Passed along in the wizard

** Example :slide:
[[file:img/WordPress-Easy-Install-4.jpg]]
*** Final Step  :notes:
    + The final step has all of the data, mixed between last page options and
      =hidden= fields
    + It creates the account with all of the options
    + Another alternative is using a Cookie to track user
      + Storing state for that user
      + But how long do we store the data for? (We don't know for sure that the
        user is done)
      + What if the user explores options by using different tabs?

* HTTP is Stateless :slide:
  + Cookies can simulate state
  + But must be passed along each request
  + And cannot be trusted by the server
** Good Things :notes:
   + Seems like a PITA, but turns out to be the right choice
   + Composability leads to flexibility:
     + Can use any datastore to keep user ID info
     + Can use any authentication scheme: email, OpenID, etc.
   + Lack of trust leads to better security
     + vallet key
     + DRM trusted the DVD players, but what happened when the players got
       hacked?
