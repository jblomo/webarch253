* Midterm :slide:
  + Designed for *1.5 hours*, 3 hours available
  + May bring *8.5x11 cheat sheet*
  + Question types including:
    + Fill in the blank
    + Short sentences
    + Multiple choice
  + Covers all lectures including REST
** Covers :notes:
   + Since we didn't have homework on it, won't expect too many technical
     details on REST

* Browsers :slide:
  + What is the DOM?
  + What are the essential tasks of a browser?
** Answers :notes:
   + Browser
     + DNS hostname lookup
     + send receive data over TCP/IP via HTTP(S)
     + discover and download dependencies
     + create DOM
     + apply CSS
     + Display
     + executing code
     + Respond to user actions
   + Tree structure used to model HTML

** Homework :slide:
   + Purpose of homework was to make sure every one tried different browsers
   + Think of the trade-offs the browsers made
   + Think about what technologies were behind that flexibility and features

* HTML :slide:
  + What are some examples of non-semantic tags?
  + What are the advantages of using tags as opposed to ASCII marks?
  + What is other example of HyperText?
  + What elements are used for 1) the content of the page, 2) the metadata of
    the page?
** Answers :notes:
   + =blink=, =font=
   + Easier to compose, can't get confused when you want to use markup character
   + wiki text
   + =body=, =head=

** CSS :slide:
   + Why separate style and content?
   + What does cascading mean?
   + What are some CSS selectors?
   + When should you use the =style= HTML attribute?
** Answers :notes:
   + You can present content in different ways (like these slides)
   + Styles can "cascade" over one another, applying the result of all
     stylesheets to the elements
   + =.class= =#id= =parent descendent=
   + When you don't have access to the stylesheet

** Homework :slide:
   + Purpose was to use different elements appropriately
   + =table= used for tabular data, =div= for layout
   + use CSS instead of =font= tag to set text styles

* Forms :slide:
  + What does the =method= attribute in the form specify?
  + What are some =input= types?
  + Why is Javascript useful with forms?
  + Can the server trust data if there is Javascript validation?
** Answers :notes:
   + HTTP method, =GET= or =POST=
   + =text= =checkbox= =password=
   + Helpful to provide instant validation
   + No, must re-validate to avoid manual attacks

** Javascript :slide:
   + What are two conceptual ways to remove elements from a page?
*** Answers :notes:
    + Set the CSS property (eg. =display: hidden=) or remove from the DOM

** Homework: Madlibs :slide:
   + Purpose was to practice using Javascript
   + Get used to event driven nature (stuff happens when you interact with page)
   + Pracice updating a page after an interaction

* URIs & HTTP :slide:
  + =foo://example.com:8042/over/there/index.dtb?type=animal&name=narwhal#nose=
  + what are the parts of this URL?
  + How is a filesystem like a DOM?
  + Does HTTP use relative or absolute paths?
  + webservers map _ to resources and return _
** Answers :notes:
   + parts:
     + foo :: schema
     + example.com :: domain / authority
     + 8042 :: port
     + /over/there/index.dtb :: path
     + type=animal&name=narwhal :: query
     + nose :: fragment
   + both represented by trees
   + absolute
   + URLs, representations

** Web Servers :slide:
   + What are the =OK= and =NOT FOUND= return codes?
   + How do we create a custom =NOT FOUND= page?
   + Why is HTTP/1.1 connection reuse helpful?
** Answers :notes:
   + =200=, =404=
   + Write HTML content in the response body
   + Setting up connections causes page load latency

** Homework: Telnet :slide:
   + purpose was to practice speaking HTTP
   + HTTP request consists of a method, absolute path, version, headers, and
     body/content
   + Browser helps by "following" redirects, running searches, etc.
#+begin_src http
PUT /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

HTTP/1.0 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

*** Redirects :slide:
    + Browswer GETs http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/foo
    + Server returns a =302= with =Location= /
    + Browser GETS http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/
    + Server returns a =301= with =Location=  http://www.people.ischool.berkeley.edu/index.php
    + Browser GETs http://www.people.ischool.berkeley.edu/index.php
    + (Sometimes would return a https if logged in)

* State & Dynamic Webpages :slide:
  + Does HTTP have state?
  + How can you tell?
  + What are the disadvantages to server generated pages?
  + Should images on =yelp.com= homepage be served dynamically or statically?
** Answers :notes:
   + No
   + It must resend all context for each request
   + Usually slower than static
   + Static since they do not change

** HTTP Data :slide:
   + Where are query arguments in a =GET= request?
   + Where are query arguements in a =POST= request?
   + Why is =Content-Length= needed to send data in a =PUT= request?
   + What are some example MIME types?
*** Answers :notes:
   + query section of the URL
   + Request body
   + So the server knows how long to wait for data
   + =audio/mp4= =text/html=

** Homework :slide:
   + Purpose was to practice sending data to the server, see how the server can
     respond dynamically
   + Understand how =Content-Type= affects the interpretation of data

** Cookies :slide:
  + Why are cookies used?
  + In normal usage, how is the cookie data set?
  + Cookies are structured as _ - _ pairs
  + How do we prevent important cookies from being spied and intercepted?
  + Without cookies, can we tell if a user is logged in with a typical =GET=
    request?
  + Why set cookie expire times in 2037?
*** Answers :notes:
   + Synchronize state between client and server
   + Set-Cookie server response header (ie by the server)
   + key-value
   + HTTPS Only cookie attribute
   + No
   + So we can stay logged in (or at least remembered) after the browser
     restarts

** REST :slide:
   + What is an example of a RESTful system?
   + Is a Noun endpoint / URL an indicator of a non-RESTful, or RESTful system?
   + Is using =POST= for all commands an indicator of a non-RESTful, or RESTful system?
   + What is the primary trade-off for composable systems like REST?
*** Answers :notes:
    + The Web
    + RESTful because a Noun typically indicates a Resource
    + non-RESTful because it is not using a Uniform Interface (=GET=, =PUT=, ...)
    + Flexibility for single-purpose performance
