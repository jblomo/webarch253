* REST :slide:center:
Representational State Transfer

* Good news, everyone! :slide:two_col:
  + You already know REST
  + Representations
  + State
  + Transfer
[[file:img/good_news_everyone.png]]
** Definitions :notes:
   + Representations :: concrete version (bytes) of a resource
   + State :: The status of a representation (bank account)
   + Transfer :: HTTP

* History :slide:two_col:
  + Roy Fielding wrote HTTP specs
  + Defined REST in his 2000 PhD dissertation
  + Defined core set of constraints and why they were important
[[file:img/roy_fielding_sq.jpg]]
** Relation to HTTP :notes:
   + REST was designed as the principles of HTTP
   + HTTP came out of and embodies these principles
   + But HTTP is not REST!

* Constraints :slide:
  + Client-server :: Two separate systems talk to each other through a well
    defined interface
  + Stateless :: No context is stored between requests
  + Cacheable :: Clients or intermediaries can cache results, and requests and
    results can specify caching information
  + Layered :: Requests can go through intermediaries (proxies)
  + Uniform Interface :: The protocol between client and server follows the
    same rules regardless of the specific application
  + Code Transfer (Optional):: Servers may send code to clients to execute
** Describes the Web :notes:
   + Browsers, webservers
   + HTTP is stateless
   + We have caching layers, CDNs (in another lecture)
   + Proxies, both front end backend (another lecture)
   + HTTP is uniform if you're getting a page from your portfolio or a CSS file
     from NYT

** Client-Server :slide:two_col:
   + Browsers don't care what webserver is providing representations, or what
     database is holding data
   + Servers don't care which clients are connecting


   + Overhead of transferring data
   + Fewer, simpler failure modes
** Flexibility :notes:
   + Theme of many of these constraints
   + We are trading off flexibility for performance

** Stateless :slide:two_col:
   + Simplifies server design and storage
   + Simplifies request grammar
   + Improves scalability, error recovery


   + Overhead of transferring client state
   + Not convenient for interactivity at protocol level
*** Grammar :notes:
   + Must cover all possible states, eg. in a directory that is deleted

** Cacheable :slide:two_col:
   + Browsers can store CSS and JavaScript
   + Businesses can cache responses, even from external sites
   + Servers can specify how long things should be cached for


   + Cache invalidation is hard
   + Can't rely on updated resources updating "everywhere"
*** Consistency is hard anyway :notes:
    + Cache invalidation is hard, but alternative is basically not feasible
    + Can't update mobile phones in "real time" when they are disconnected

** Layered :slide:two_col:
  + Apache webserver is an intermediary to =app.py=, but the browser doesn't know!
  + Allows "one" hostname to be served by hundreds of '=app.py=' servers
  + Can also separate caching, or authentication and authorization


  + Can't rely on server specific details - our request could be passed along
    to anyone
  + Server identification more difficult - "Man in the Middle" attacks
*** Man in the Middle :notes:
    + Where an adversary intercepts your requests and returns back potentially
      altered results

** Uniform Interface :slide:two_col:
  + Client and server know how to interact regardless of application hosted
  + Yelp uses same interface as Twitter
  + Wider variety of clients that can handle multiple applications


  + For really unique applications, must jam into old paradigms
  + Difficult to optimize for performance of single application
*** Clients :notes:
    + Imagine using a different application for Yelp and Twitter: one has no
      back button, other can't select text, etc...
      + Actually don't have to imagine too hard, just use your phone
    + Difficult to think about what a "resource" is for search

** Code on Demand :slide:two_col:
   + Server sends code to execute on client
   + JavaScript, Java, Flash, VisualBasic
   + Can allow interaction without rebuilding representation


   + Difficult to ensure code safety and isolation
   + Sandboxing limits performance and flexibility
*** Sandbox :notes:
    + An area for a program to run that won't let it do real damage
    + Prevent a virus from reading your personal finances
    + But this means can't allow the program to helpfully read data

* REST is not HTTP :slide:two_col:
  + Other protocols are "RESTful"
  + Waka is Roy Fielding's next protocol
  + Must embrace REST constraints
[[file:img/MagrittePipe.jpg]]
** New Protocols? :notes:
   + If you want to make it RESTful, try following Fielding advice
   + Worked pretty well for the Web

* Web is RESTful :slide:
  + Web is build on these ideas
  + Better leverage attained by embracing REST
  + Flexibility, scalability, visibility, simplicity

* How to Spot RESTfulness :slide:
  + Should think through constraints, but here are some heuristics

** Uses HTTP :slide:
   + HTTP can be a Uniform Interface
   + vs. FTP not RESTful

** Uses HTTP commands :slide:
   + =GET= =POST= =PUT= ...
   + vs. Uses POST for everything

** Uses HTTP return codes :slide:
   + =404= =200=
   + vs. always responses with =200= but has an error message

** URLs point to resources :slide:
   + =/api/users/jblomo= =/api/classes/i253=
   + vs. URLs point to commands =/api/command= =/api/user= =/api/getClasses/=
*** =/api/user= :notes:
    + Where =/api/user= then only takes =POST= commands with a =user=jblomo=
      argument
    + Fielding called this "Identification of resources"

** Representation links :slide:
   + A representation links to new possible actions
   + Client only needs to have representation
   + Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
*** HATEOAS :notes:
    + HTTP contains links to the next action: the business you want to view,
      or forms with actions for the review you want to submit
    + You don't need to memorize the prefix of businesses, then type in an ID
    + Contains the full URL link

** Example :slide:
#+begin_src json
{"business": "http://yelp.com/biz/27",
 "user": "http://yelp.com/user/5"
 "review_text": "..."}
#+end_src
*** Trade-offs :notes:
    + Can easily follow links without known a priori structure
    + Only need "entry" URL to start using API/website

** Counter Example :slide:
#+begin_src json
{"business_id": 27,
 "user_id": 5
 "review_text": "..."}
#+end_src
#+begin_src python
url.open("http://yelp.com/biz/" + business_id)
#+end_src
*** Trade-offs :notes:
    + Less data transfered
    + Got back just a simple ID... what do we do with it?
    + Some APIs require you to read the documentation, then hard code the path
      and stick the ID you got in the response in
    + Note HATEOAS: Instead should receive the whole URL in this response

** Uses Headers for Metadata :slide:
   + =Content-Type= XML or JSON
   + vs. response has extra metadata in XML
*** SOAP :notes:
    + For example [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP][SOAP]] has a
      =<soap:Header>= section
    + Self-descriptive: client can figure out how to parse from the message
      content, not some external source

* A place for the RESTless :slide:
  + Communicating over many protocols
  + Performance critical
  + Prototypes
